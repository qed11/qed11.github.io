            Welcome to my webpage. This site is used to host some of my open-source resources and notes, 
            and is currently under construction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an Aerospace Engineering student studying at the University of Toronto.
            My primary interest lies in development of numerical methods for aerospace applications and optimization, specifically for hypersonic vehicles and motor sports.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            I worked at <a href = "https://www.spaceryde.com/">SpaceRyde</a> as a propulsion intern from Sept, 2022 to Feb, 2023, designing Canada's first orbital-class rocket. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I previously worked in the 2022 summer with Prof. Masayuki Yano from <a href = "http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~myano/">ACE Lab</a> 
            at <a href = "https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/">UTIAS</a>, learning about numerical methods and optimization schemes for airfoil geometry optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also previously worked at <a href = "https://www.legere.com/">Légère Reeds</a> lead by Prof. Mark Kortschot, as a design engineer intern for 2 summers in 2020 and 2021,
            where I worked on optimizing of the design process of synthetic instrument reeds.

            I dream to become an educator who shapes students dreams,
            and I have been teaching physics for Grade 11 and 12 students at <a href="https://perfectedu.ca/">Perfect Education</a>.
        </p>
        <p>         
            Apart from academia, I am an Oboist/English Hornist. I have previously served as the 
            oboist in the <a href="https://www.tso.ca/toronto-symphony-youth-orchestra">Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra</a>, 
            and am currently studying with <a href="https://www.tso.ca/orchestra/members-of-the-orchestra/hugo-lee/">Hugo Lee</a> from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy listening to classical music, and if you are interested, 
            here are some <a href="music/album.html">albums</a> that I like.
