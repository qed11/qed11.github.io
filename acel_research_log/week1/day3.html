    <h4>
        Summary
    </h4>
    Today finished reading chapter 1 notes (I know it's quite slowly), and started to work on the problem set. 
    First two parts of exercise 1 has been finished, although the answer I gave in Q2 is not necessarily correct. 
    I aim to start implementing the solver as soon as possible, using FE scheme instead of FD schemes taught in AER336.
    This part requires chapter 3 knowledge. 

    <br>
    On the other hand, I have solved a few questions that I didn't grasp very well during the school year regarding FEA 
    and variational methods. 
    <ol>
        <li>The derivative of the lagrange basis used in a linear interpolation is exactly the segment length. 
            The lagrange basis is defined in the <a href = "../resources/yano_aer336_notes_w2022.pdf">AER336 notes</a>. 
            On segment $K_i \equiv [x_{i-1}, x_{i}]$, the lagrange basis polynomial is given as
            $$l_i(x) \equiv \frac{x - x_{i-1}}{x_{i} - x_{i-1}}$$ 
            Taking the derivative with respect to $x$, we get $$\frac{dl_i}{dx} = \frac{1}{x_i - x_{i-1}} = \frac{1}{h_i}$$
        </li>
    </ol>
