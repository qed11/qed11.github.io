    Today's main objective is to complete question 1 in the problem set. 
    <ul>
        <li>A very important realization: the finite element method is defined continuously everywhere.
            This means that between the nodes, there are analytical expressions for the approximation. Hence, derivatives and integrals
            can be conveniently taken for the entire domain, and many more other properties can be utilized. 
        </li>
    </ul>
