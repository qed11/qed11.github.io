                Welcome to my webpage! This site is used to host some of my open-source resources and notes, 
                and is currently under construction.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an Aerospace Engineering student studying at University of Toronto.
                My primary interest lies in the development and applications of civil hypersonic vehicles, 
                particularly in the aerodynamic design and propulsion system optimizaitons.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I am currently working with Prof. Masayuki Yano from <a href = "http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~myano/">ACEL Lab</a> 
                developing adaptive mesh refinement algorithms for aerodynamic shape optimization.
                Afterwards, I will be joining <a href = "https://www.spaceryde.com/">SpaceRyde</a> starting from September of 2022 as a propulsion intern. 
                Previously, I have been working in the team lead by Prof. Mark Kortschot at
                <a href = "https://www.legere.com/">Légère Reeds</a> as a design engineer intern optimizing design process of synthetic instrument Reeds
            </p>
            You can find my 2022 Research Log at ACEL <a href = "acel_research_log/acel_summer_2022.html">here</a>.

                Apart from academia, I am an Oboist/English Hornist. I have Previously served as the 
                oboist in the <a href="https://www.tso.ca/toronto-symphony-youth-orchestra">Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra</a>, 
                and is currently studying with <a href="https://www.tso.ca/orchestra/members-of-the-orchestra/hugo-lee/">Hugo Lee</a> from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.
