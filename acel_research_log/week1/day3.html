        Summary
    </h4>
    Today finished reading chapter 1 notes (I know it's quite slowly), and started to work on the problem set. 
    First two parts of exercise 1 has been finished, although the answer I gave in Q2 is not necessarily correct. 
    I aim to start implementing the solver as soon as possible, using FE scheme instead of FD schemes taught in AER336.
    This part requires chapter 3 knowledge. 

    <br>
    On the other hand, I have solved a few questions that I didn't grasp very well during the school year regarding FEA 
    and variational methods.
