# Investigation:

 * compute a reference solution with parameters given by professor Yano
 * use the same mesh for the reference solution and optimization 
 	* Scale the mesh by a factor of 4
 	* Max iteration: 8
 * use different mesh for reference solution and optimization
 	* no adaptation iterations
 	* start with a coarser mesh
 		*issue: cannot make the mesh scale lower than 1.0
 	* start with a finer mesh
