            Welcome to my webpage. This site is used to host some of my open-source resources and notes, 
            and is currently under construction.

        <p>
            I am an Aerospace Engineering student studying at University of Toronto.
            My primary interest lies in the development and applications of civil hypersonic vehicles, 
            particularly in the aerodynamic design and propulsion system optimizaitons. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            This summer, I am working with Prof. Masayuki Yano from <a href = "http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~myano/">Aerospace Computational Engineering Lab</a> 
            here in <a href = "https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies</a>, 
            developing adaptive mesh refinement algorithms for aerodynamic shape optimization.
            Afterwards, I will be joining <a href = "https://www.spaceryde.com/">SpaceRyde</a>, 
            starting from September of 2022, as a propulsion intern. I have previously worked at
            <a href = "https://www.legere.com/">Légère Reeds</a> lead by Prof. Mark Kortshot as a design engineer intern, working on
            optimizing design process of synthetic instrument reeds.

            Apart from academia, I am an Oboist/English Hornist. I have previously served as the 
            oboist in the <a href="https://www.tso.ca/toronto-symphony-youth-orchestra">Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra</a>, 
            and is currently studying with <a href="https://www.tso.ca/orchestra/members-of-the-orchestra/hugo-lee/">Hugo Lee</a> from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

        <p>
            I enjoy listening to classical music, and if you are interested, 
            here are some <a href="music/album.html">albums</a> that I like.
