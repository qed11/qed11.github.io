    The 1D linear FEM code has been updated with analytical solutions for the approximation functions
    <ul>
        <li>As noted from yesterday's log, the approximation function is piecewise continuous over the domain.
            The FE approximation can then be used to construct analytical solutions around the whole domain, with defined derivatives as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Currently only linear basis functions are used, which means that it's an linear interpolation between each nodes.
            But when it comes to quadratic basis functions, the spaces between each node is defined by a linear combination of the basis functions.
        </li>
    </ul>
