            Welcome to my webpage. This site is used to host some of my open-source resources and notes, 
            and is currently under construction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an Aerospace Engineering student studying at the University of Toronto.
            My primary industrial interest lies in development of numerical methods for aerospace applications and optimization, specifically for hypersonic vehicles and motor sports.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            I worked at <a href = "https://www.spaceryde.com/">SpaceRyde</a> as a propulsion intern since September of 2022. I previously worked with Prof. Masayuki Yano from <a href = "http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~myano/">Aerospace Computational Engineering Lab</a> 
            at the <a href = "https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies</a>, learning about numerical methods for airfoil geometry optimization, 
            and I have previously worked at <a href = "https://www.legere.com/">Légère Reeds</a> lead by Prof. Mark Kortschot as a design engineer intern, where I worked on
            optimizing of the design process of synthetic instrument reeds.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also been teaching physics for Grade 11 and 12 students at <a href="https://perfectedu.ca/">Perfect Education</a>.

            Apart from academia, I am an Oboist/English Hornist. I have previously served as the 
            oboist in the <a href="https://www.tso.ca/toronto-symphony-youth-orchestra">Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra</a>, 
            and am currently studying with <a href="https://www.tso.ca/orchestra/members-of-the-orchestra/hugo-lee/">Hugo Lee</a> from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy listening to classical music, and if you are interested, 
            here are some <a href="music/album.html">albums</a> that I like.
